# ButterClient-Patch-Server
Patch server for the ButterClient!
# About
The pupose of this patch server is to provide a way for MHF servers to distribute file changes to users while minimizing the amount of time spent checksumming and the amount of data transfered.
With this, it should be much easier to ensure users always get the latest translations, custom skins, game fixes, etc.
